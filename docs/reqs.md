# Productivity App ðŸŽ¢

## Description

Productivity is a new trend in this modern time where efficiency is a key part of the work culture. As human beings, our concentration and focus do not always cooperate in the way we predict or want. That is why there are many techniques for improving productivity and work management. With this app, we want to create a web application that can be accessed by people struggling with productivity management, and help them handle their workload better. The app needs to have techniques such as the Pomodoro Technique, Pomodoro planning, Calendar scheduling, Doing the most important task first, etc.
