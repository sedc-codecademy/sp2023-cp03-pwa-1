# Adding Graphs and Charts to a project 📊
## Why graphs and charts 📈
For projects that are working with data or statistics, it is really convenient for the users to see that data or statistics in a graphic form in stead of just see a lot of numbers and words. This is especially important if you want to draw the users attention and convince them to stick a little bit longer on your page. Graphs are usually added to reinforce some idea or some output such as historical data, comparison data and statistical views. 

## How do I create a graph and charts 📈
Graphs and Charts for web-pages are usually not created on their own. Most of the time there is a library that does this work for us. Implementing a graph or a chart without a library can take a lot of time and resources depending on the data and design of the graph needed. This is why there are many libraries that help developers implement graphs easily in their projects. In order for us to use these libraries we first need to chose one, read the documentation, make sure that the library offers all the functionalities that we would need, and then implement the library in our project with the help of the documentation and sometimes videos or tutorials.
